fork() is a way of multiprocessing in linux, using fork you can create a child process where
    everything from the parent process is copied into the child, all the memory the parent had
    stored at the time of execution. This data, when altered, does not effect the parent proccess
    since it is a deep copy and completely seperate. fork() also has several return values, at the
    start of the parent process the pid of the child that was created is returned, but inside the child
    proccess the start of the process is right where the parent left off, and if you are storing the return
    value then in the child process 0 is returned even though fork() is not actaully called at the
    start of the child process. 

execlp() is a way of executing a new program in the child instead of the parents code, the p 
    means it will take a path so that you do not need the program in the same file unlike execl().
    This will execute the given program in the current process that sees it. If it was unable
    to switch context to this new program then it will return -1.

wait() is used to pause a parent process untill a child process finishes its process, an int pointer
    can be passed to receive the exit status of the child, or use NULL if you don't care.

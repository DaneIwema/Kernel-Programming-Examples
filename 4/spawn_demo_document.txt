This program aims to create a new process that will call a completely different process image to overwrite
    the current process image. The way the program does this is with a helper function called spawn. this will 
    fork the program and create the child process, and after that it will check if its the child process and
    run th execvp function. This is the function used to replace the process image with a specified file.
    here we give it a list of arguments to call. ls is the process image we want to replace with the program
    in the child, and the arg_list is the list builds the argument vector to be called at the command line.
